# Testing and Security Analysis of Smart Contracts


## Overview
Smart contracts are immutable programs on the Blockchain that enforce legal and financial contracts. There are many reported cases of security exploits of smart contracts resulting in millions of dollars in lost coins. In this project, we are developing a variety of tools, including but not limited to combinations of static and symbolic analysis, fuzzing, and verification methods, aimed at detecting security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
